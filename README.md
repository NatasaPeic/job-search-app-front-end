# Job Searh Helper App


Job Search Helper app helps people be more efficient in a job search. It creates an extra step in job search by separating process of searching and process of applying for jobs.

It provides better track of current job openings by letting the user to save information regarding position that he/she is interested in. User will be asked to fill several fields like “position_name”, “company_name”, “company_url”, “salary”, “notes”, “applied” etc.


User will be able to update two fields - - “notes” and “applied”. Notes can be helpful in job application process. For example, if user while searching finds that company expects some Java knowledge, the user can enter that as a reminder. Field “applied” will let user update whether the user has actually applied for a job or not.
User can also delete the entire job field if job is no longer active.
